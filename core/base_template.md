# Base Template Structure

This document provides the standard structure for Gemini prompt templates. Follow this format when creating new templates to maintain consistency across the repository.

## Template Structure

### Template Name (Gemini Application)

```
[CLEAR INSTRUCTION]

[CONTEXT/BACKGROUND INFORMATION]

[SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]

[OPTIONAL: FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS]
```

**Example:**
```
[EXAMPLE OF THE TEMPLATE IN USE WITH REAL VALUES]
```

## Guidelines for Creating Templates

1. **Clear Instructions**: Start with a clear, direct instruction that tells Gemini exactly what you want it to do.

2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information or context that helps Gemini understand the task better.

3. **Specific Requirements**: Include specific details, parameters, or constraints that should guide Gemini's response.

4. **Format Instructions (Optional)**: If needed, specify how the output should be formatted (e.g., bullet points, table, paragraphs).

5. **Placeholders**: Use [BRACKETS] to indicate placeholders that users should replace with their specific information.

6. **Examples**: Always include a concrete example showing the template in use with real values.

7. **Application Indication**: Specify which Gemini application the template is designed for (e.g., Gemini in Gmail, Gemini in Docs, Gemini Advanced).

## Template Categories

Templates in this repository are organized into two main categories:

1. **Role-based Templates**: Designed for specific professional roles (e.g., administrative support, marketing, sales).

2. **Use Case-based Templates**: Designed for common tasks or scenarios across different roles (e.g., email communication, meeting management, content creation).

## Template Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the template. For example:

- "Meeting Agenda Creation" (not just "Agenda")
- "Customer Follow-up Email" (not just "Email Template")
- "Product Launch Press Release" (not just "Press Release")

## Template Testing

Before submitting a new template, test it with Gemini to ensure it produces the expected results. Refine as needed to improve the output quality.
